Dechoker can be used almost instantaneously and the user does not have to complete the Heimlich maneuver/abdominal thrust techniques to begin the use of the Dechoker device. Due to the demonstrated effectiveness of the Dechoker device, it is recommended to have the device available for immediate use.

        "en-US": "<p>Yes. The Dechoker is suitable for any patient that has a swallowing issue or disorder.

        "en-US": "What is the possibility of barotrauma?"
      },
      "answer": {
        "en-US": "<p>Barotrauma is usually associated with positive pressure, usually of the lower respiratory tract rather than the upper airway, resulting from high inflation pressures and damaging the lung parenchyma. Suction devices which generate a 'negative' (sub-atmospheric) pressure will not damage distal tissues beyond the larynx. Soft tissues in the oral cavity including the tongue may succumb to a poorly positioned device when suction is applied. A choking casualty has an unrelieved obstruction in the upper airway. They may vomit without stimulation, and this might even dislodge the foreign body in the laryngopharynx? Aspiration of stomach contents is most unlikely because the esophagus will collapse, unlike the adjacent trachea."
